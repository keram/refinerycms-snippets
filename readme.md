    rake db:migrate

## Usage

* Create Snippet on /refinery/snippets
* Now you can attach snippet to page when you click Edit this page on `/refinery/pages`. In the Snippets tab you can select the part to which you want to attach the block and add it after and/or before the html body of the part.  
* Next you can use content_of(@page, :part) to print the body of the part and the snippets attached to it in the pages views.
* You have some other interesting methods to work with snippets:
  * page.snippets: returns all the snippets attached to all the parts of page.
  * part.after: returns all the snippets attached after the html body of part.
  * part.before: returns all the snippets attached before the html body of part.
  * snippet.pages: returns all pages to whose parts is snippet attached.
  * snippet.before?(part): returns true if snippet is attached before part body.
  * snippet.after?(part): return true if snippet is attached after part body.
